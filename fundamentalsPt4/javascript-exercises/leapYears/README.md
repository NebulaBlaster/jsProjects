# Exercise XX - leapYears

Create a function that determines whether or not a given year is a leap year. Leap years are determined by the following rules:

> Leap years are years divisible by four (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years). (Yes, it's all pretty confusing)

```javascript
leapYears(2000) // is a leap year: returns true
leapYears(1985) // is not a leap year: returns false
```


## Hints
- use an `if` statement and `&&` to make sure all the conditions are met properly

r i could just do this or i could just do this
i think this is anice keyboard

but which style do i prefere? 
do i like this one bette?
i do really like how this feels though. This one is tough. i do really like they skeyboard. i guess i just know that i need to throw away my macally keeboardits really kinda disappointing that this keyboard does not have any sort of built in backlighting. but damn do i really like thow this feels when im typing
]
i think i can actually type a litttle bvit fater and more accurate with the above dkeyhbnoard
every seingle keyh can be felt when im using this keyboars.
jor do i like this one better?
i think that this one iss a bit more smoth and actually hits the keys faster
thswi one is also really fucking loud which is a bit annoying but i seem to type really well on it

do i have more mistakes with this keyboard? or do i i just need to get used to it? 

THis one does not light up which is kinda gay. i really like the ones that light uup 
this one does light up which is really nice. it is a little bit noisey but it slaso s=hmmm
i guess i could jujst
use this keyboard if its the same as the blue keys
but this one does seem really to type better. i can't beleive that this is the quite keyborad according to the reiveiws i gotta imagine that the blue keys would be pretty craxy. 
i bet they are are at least this loiud. butr who lnoiws
well its hard to tell which one i actually like better. i have to admit i like the way that his one feels as im pressing in th keys more. it has a nice feel to it. not like im going to over do it but enough that its easy to type. here on the other hadn its pretty easy to type its pretty noisey. i dont know if the other one is worth 170 bucks when this works just fine and lights up and the key mappings are working how i want them to. hmm
hard to tell. wait, ready for what? a test a real challange. to determine if you have what it takes to become a Jedi or not. But you said i was a Jedi, but you lack discipline, Focus.

I want ot become the Jedi that you see 
I might regret this. I know you can. Star Wars the Clone Wars
so, where are we headed for this shit? huh? oh man does this keyboard feel really good. 
This is much more quiet that the rest of the keyboards that i have. Everything was different back then. only the connecton to the force can leacd you to the temple.
